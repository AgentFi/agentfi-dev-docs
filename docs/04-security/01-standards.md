# Standards
---

The AgentFi Protocol was built using many common and heavily audited standards such as ERC721 Nonfungible Tokens and ERC6551 Token Bound Accounts.

Many of our contracts are built with the open source Openzeppelin library or Future Primitive's AccountV3.

The Agents also support ERC4337 Account Abstraction for those that would like to use alternative key management or gas settings.
