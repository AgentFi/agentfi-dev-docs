**EOA**: An Externally Owned Address. An account on the blockchain that is controlled by a private key. Example: a metamask wallet.

**NFT**: An [ERC721 Non Fungible Token](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

**TBA**: An [ERC6551 Token Bound Account](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551).



**DEX (Decentralized Exchange)**: Decentralized exchanges are platforms that enable users to trade crypto peer-to-peer on the blockchain without any intermediaries.

**Pool**: A basket of one or more assets that anyone can deposit into. These assets may be used to generate and distribute yield.

**Liquidity pool**: A type of pool with two or more assets. Traders may trade between the assets in the pool, paying a fee in the process. Example: Uniswap V2 WETH/USDC pair.

**Liquidity provider**: A liquidity provider provides funds to the liquidity pool. They earn a portion of the fees from transactions using the pool.

**Vault**: A type of pool with one asset and earns yield in the same asset. Example: Yearn yvWETH, Aave aDAI.

**APR (Annual Percentage Rate)**: The APR is the annual rate of return of a deposit, not taking into account compounding interest

**APY (Annual Percentage Yield)**: The APY is the annual rate of return of a deposit, taking into account compounding interest. (Example: a $1000 deposit compounded annually with a 6% APY  would return $1000 * (1.06) the first year and ($1000 * (1.06)) * 1.06 the second year, etc.)



**EVM**: The Ethereum Virtual Machine is the computation engine for Ethereum that manages the state of the blockchain and enables smart contract functionality.

**L2**: A Layer 2 network is a blockchain that utilizes an underlying Layer 1 network for consensus but not compute. This allows the L2 to remain secure and enhances the scalability of the Layer 1 by offloading computations. Blast is a Layer 2 that settles on Ethereum as its Layer 1.
