### History

On March 2 2024, we released the Blastooor Genesis collection, a set of 6551 NFTs on the Blast L2 network. The collection sold out in minutes, totaling 6400 NFTs @ 0.01 ETH. The remaining 151 were reserved for the team, strategic partners, and rewards.

On March 28 2024, we released the Blastooor Strategies collection along with the rest of the AgentFi dapp, allowing users to manage their agents and funds. This release also included the Dex Balancer strategy, allowing users to invest their ETH and USDB into Ring Protocol, Blasterswap, and Thruster/Hyperlock.

On April 4 2024, we released the Multipliooor strategy, allowing users to easily farm Blast multipliers without having to use 12 separate dapps.
